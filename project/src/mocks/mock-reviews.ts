    comment: 'This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction.\nI was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.',
